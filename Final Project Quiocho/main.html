	<p>Have you ever noticed the world getting a little too hot or cold lately? Climate in hot places like the Sahara desrt are starting to become cold. Vegetation has started 
	to grow in Antarctica. Icecaps are melting so sea levels are getting way higher than it's supposed to be. All of these disasters are caused by global warming. It's a serious
	issue that affects most of us but honestly, the majority does not care about fixing it since the things we do that cause global warming are very convenient for us to live
	our daily lives. Ignorance to a matter like this can be life threatening-which is why this website exists! 	
	<br>
	The Earth is absolutely awesome! There are still so much places that have barely been touched by humans and they all look so enchanting. This website aims to educate people
	about the dangers of climate change and we also would like to try and promote the beauty of the Earth! This helps YOU realize that maybe the lives of polar bears, birds, fish,
	dogs, cats, rhinos, turtles, plants, and your fellow humans are actually worth the extra money to use an eco bag instead of a plastic bag from your local 7-11; by the way, it's
	also reusable, so it's convinient. If you want to be a part of saving the Earth, before you go and join some actual projects, how about you take the time to read and be informed
	with this website!
