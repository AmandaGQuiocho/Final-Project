	Fossil fuels are no stranger to us. Coal, oil, and gas are helpful for our daily necessities especially for transportation. Plastic is also not unfamiliar. It's a cheap
	alternative to any other container or bag and it lasts long-longer than what the planet can take. The greenhouse gases these fuels and burning plastic can emmit are rapidly
	increasing year by year. These gases create a layer in the earth's atmosphere that trap all the heat inside. Who's to blame? Humans. We have been using too  much fossil fuels
	to the point that we have successfully created a blanket for our planet that could lead to our demise for the sake of a few innovationss.
